          In order to optimize availability and ensure a sustainable rental
          process, equipment listed on Focal is provided based on user requests.
          Once a rental request is confirmed by the owner, they will prepare the
          item for pick-up or delivery. Rental preparation typically takes 1-3
          business days, depending on the owner's schedule.
          <br />
          Please note that some delays may occur due to unforeseen
          circumstances, including public holidays or events affecting delivery.
